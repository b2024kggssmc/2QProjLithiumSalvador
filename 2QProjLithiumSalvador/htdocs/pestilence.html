        <h4>Revelation 6:1-2 (KJV)</h4>
        <p>"And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. And I saw, and 
            behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer."</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p> The first horseman that will enter earth at the end of the world is Pestilence. He is described to be on a white horse carrying a bow and wearing a crown, 
            who "went forth conquering". The word "Pestilence" is associated with plague and disease. Because of this, one interpretation suggests that Pestilence will 
            be the carrier of diseases among the four horsemen. This interpretation can confirm that diseases will be present in the end of the world plaguing humanity.
