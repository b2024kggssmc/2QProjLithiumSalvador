        <h4>Revelation 6:3-4 (KJV) </h4>
        <p>"And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to 
            him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword."</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p> The second horseman that will enter earth at the end of the world is War. He is described to be on a red horse and is carrying a great sword. It is obvious 
            that he is War as suggested by the fact that he is capable of taking away earth's peace and make everyone in it kill each other (hence the name "War"). This 
            interpretation confirms that during the end of the world, people won't work together to survive the end of the world but will instead destroy each other.
