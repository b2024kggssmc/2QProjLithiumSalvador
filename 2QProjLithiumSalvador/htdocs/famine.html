        <h4>Revelation  6:5-6 (KJV)</h4>
        <p>"And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of 
            balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; 
            and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine."</p>

        <p> The second horseman that will enter earth at the end of the world is Famine. He is described to be on a black horse and is carrying a balances. The balances 
            symbolize the world's economy, but more importantly, the destruction of it. This interpretation suggests that there will be a famine, which will destroy the 
            world's economy. The demand for food will be ridiculously high as the food supply gets ridiculously low, and a lot of people will die of hunger.
